# hangoutsbot-locales
Translation project for Hangoutsbot

# Contributor/Developer Guide
If you are initialising this repo as a submodule of the hangoutsbot project,
  the submodules repository will be in a 'detached HEAD' state. It is highly
  advisable that you `git checkout master` inside the submodule dir
  to enable tracking if you intend to commit changes directly from the
  superproject.

To allow anonymous cloning of this repo as a submodule, `.gitmodules` in
  the hangoutsbot superproject is configured with the read-only url `https://...`.
  For most users and administrators, this is sufficient. On the other
  hand, if you are a developer who intends to push changes to this repo
  from the superproject, you will also have to set your local `pushURL`.
  The easiest way to do this is to execute this command within the
  submodule path:
```
git config remote.origin.pushurl git@github.com:das7pad/hangoutsbot-locales.git
```

We recommend always testing and building translations based on the **dev** branch
  of the bot.
